//TEXTBOX CLASS
//This class is responsible for the textboxes that appear when the character interacts
//with objects and doors in the game
//There are two kinds of textboxes: pure text and yes and no questions
//The parameters will be the type of textbox and the words that go inside it
//position, size and color will be fixed, so they do not need to be included in the 
//arguments
